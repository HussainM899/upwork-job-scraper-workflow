A simple web app collects inputs through a standard form and three small chatbots that convert conversations into numeric scores. Excel then generates the plan, and a final chatbot explains the results. This is a fast, scrappy MVP meant only to showcase the concept — not a production tool or real financial advice system.\n\nFull Explanation: \n\nI’m building an MVP “AI financial advisor” where Excel is the single source of truth for all calculations. The web app and chatbots only collect inputs and display outputs; they should not recreate any financial logic. This is a demo proof-of-concept for a potential startup, not a production tool and not real financial planning. It just needs to work reliably enough to show the concept and guide someone through a mock plan.\n\nOverall User Flow:\n\nStep 1 – Simple Web Form (like a Google Form).\nThe user begins on a clean web page with a standard form where they enter age, income, rent or mortgage, savings, investments, debts, and similar basic data. These values are passed directly into the Excel financial model as numeric inputs.\n\nStep 2 – Three Small Chatbots That Convert Conversation into Numbers.\nAfter completing the form, the user goes through three short chatbot flows (for things like risk tolerance and other qualitative preferences). Each chatbot asks a few open-ended questions, collects a brief transcript, and sends that transcript to the OpenAI API with instructions such as: “Based on this conversation, assign a risk score from 1–10 and return only the number.” The API returns a single numeric value (for example, 7 for risk), and that number is passed into Excel as another input. In the end, Excel receives numeric data from two places: (1) the initial web form and (2) the three conversation-to-number chatbots.\n\nStep 3 – Excel Calculates the Plan.\nOnce all numeric inputs are ready, the user clicks “See my plan” or a similar button. Excel runs its formulas and produces simple outputs such as “Save $250/month” and other key recommendations. The web app displays these results on a clean results page as the user’s plan.\n\nStep 4 – Final Explanatory Chatbot (Q&A About Their Plan).\nAfter seeing the results, the user can talk to a generalist explanatory chatbot. For the MVP, this is simple: we bundle the user’s inputs and the Excel outputs together into a single system/context message and feed that into the OpenAI API. The chatbot then answers questions like “Why do I need to save $250/month?” or “How did my risk score affect this?” This chatbot does not need to write back into Excel or perform live recalculations; it just explains and reasons over the static plan snapshot.\n\nWhat I Need From You:\nImplement the full flow (form → three intake chatbots → Excel calculation → results page → final explanatory chatbot). Excel should remain the backend calculator unless there is an unavoidable technical issue. You should choose a simple, maintainable architecture and explain it clearly. This is a scrappy demo MVP, so shortcuts are acceptable as long as the experience works smoothly.",
